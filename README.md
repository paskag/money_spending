# A program for monitoring and analyzing financial expenses

## Background
#### When I moved to Israel, I decided that I needed to keep track of my expenses. I could have used third-party applications, but I decided that I wanted to create something of my own.

## Functions
 * **info_by_period** - You can get information on spending over an arbitrary period of time

 * **info_by_month** - You can get information on your spending for the month

 * **info_by_year** - You can get information on your spending for the year


 * **annual report** - You can get a detailed annual report. Information will be provided for each month.
